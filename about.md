## About me

My name is Michael Roach; I'm a Research Associate (bioinformatician) at the new Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome 
Exploration at Flinders University (oPiNiOnS aRe My oWn). 

I previously worked at the Australian Wine Research Institute where I assembled the Chardonnay genome and developed a
new gold standard for grapevine clonal marker discovery. I wrote the pipeline Purge Haplotigs for heterozygous diploid
assembly cleanup, and contributed to many other various yeast genomics projects etc.

My Honours and PhD was in drug discovery, not genomics, and involved identifying and testing candidate structural 
inhibitors of malarial enzymes which required a lot of protein homology modelling and _in silico_ screening.

The transition from protein to DNA bioinformatics was equal parts challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited about the
new move from genomics to metagenomics. My Research interests include all things bioinformatics, data viz and graphic 
design, software dev, and more recently webapp dev.

Outside of work I'm an enthusiast brewer and BCJP certified beer judge (bjcp.org), but wine is good too.
I play video games, am a hockey goalie, and generally have too many interests and too little time.

This site is intended to be a collection of stuff I've done, stuff I'm doing, and stuff I think is neat. 
If you're interested in what I'm doing then great!
If you googled your way here to debug some perl code your supervisor gave you then, good luck!
