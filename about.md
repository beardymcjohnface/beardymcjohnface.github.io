## About me

My name is Michael Roach and I'm a Research Scientist (bioinformatician) at the Australian Wine Research Institute (oPiNiOnS aRe My oWn).
I'm currently working on multiple projects, the biggest recently being the Chardonnay genome project. 
My contributions to other projects have predominantly involved various yeast genomes and analyses.
While my field at the moment is very much genomics, my background was actually in drug discovery. 
My Honours and PhD involved identifying and testing candidate structural inhibitors of malarial enzymes which required a lot of protein homology modelling and _in silico_ screening.

Since joining the AWRI, I've occasionally managed to return to these roots and even expand into some Molecular Dynamics simulations.
Otherwise, the transition from protein to DNA bioinformatics has been equal parts challenging and rewarding.
My Research interests include all things genomics and protein structure, data viz and graphic design, bioinf software dev, and more recently webapp dev.

Outside of work I'm an enthusiast brewer and BCJP certified beer judge (bjcp.org), but wine is good too.
I play video games, am a hockey goalie, and generally have too many interests and too little time.

This site is intended to be a collection of stuff I've done, stuff I'm doing, and stuff I think is neat. 
If you're interested in what I'm doing then great!
If you googled your way here to debug some perl code your supervisor gave you then, good luck!
